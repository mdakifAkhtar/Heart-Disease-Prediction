## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical parameters such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- ECG Results
- ST Depression
- And more...

The model is trained on a heart disease dataset and deployed using a web interface.
